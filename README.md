A lightweight application designed to detect fraud in contact center interactions. In this scenario, a fraudster calls a contact center attempting an Account Takeover (ATO) by emotionally manipulating the agent to gain unauthorized access.

The system identifies patterns of emotional manipulation in real time and alerts the agent to a likely fraud attempt. When combined with existing fraud prevention controls, an LLM-based architecture adds a powerful, adaptive layer of security and compliance.

Additionally, given that contact centers experience some of the highest employee churn rates, agent training represents a substantial ongoing cost. By embedding fraud detection directly into the workflow, this approach reduces reliance on extensive fraud-prevention training for human agents.
