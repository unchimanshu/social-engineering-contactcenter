A simple application to detect fraud in a Contact center scenario. Imagine a fraudster calling a contact center to carry out an Account Takeover (ATO). They try to emotionally manipulate the agent and try to gain access. 

This system will detect emotional manipulation and warn the agent of a probable fraud attempt. When used in conjunction with existing fraud prevention measures, an LLM-based architecture can add a powerful security and compliance layer to the system. 

Furthermore, because the contact center is one of the highest-churn industries in the world, human agent training is a significant overhead; such features can obviate the need for such fraud-prevention training for human agents.
